                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but
                effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its
                interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most
                platforms.</p>

                <p>
                    The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major
                    platforms from the Python Web site, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org" class="p-link">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains
                    distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages
                    callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

                    The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression
                    syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or
                    C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:
                </p>

                <code>>>> 2 + 2
                    4
                    >>> 50 - 5*6
                    20
                    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
                    5.0
                    >>> 8 / 5 # division always returns a floating point number
                    1.6

                <p>
                    Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in
                    single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape quotes:
                </p>
                <code>>>> 'spam eggs' # single quotes
                    'spam eggs'
                    >>> 'doesn\'t' # use \' to escape the single quote...
                    "doesn't"
                    >>> "doesn't" # ...or use double quotes instead
                    "doesn't"
                    >>> '"Yes," they said.'
                    '"Yes," they said.'
                    >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
                    '"Yes," they said.'
                    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                    '"Isn\'t," they said.'

                    Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which
                    can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of
                    different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
                </p>
                <code>>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                    >>> squares
                    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

            <article>
                <p>
                    The main control flow tools available in Python are:
                </p>
                <ul class="first-list">
                    <li>while loops</li>
                    <li>if statements</li>
                    <li>for statements</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
                <code>>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
                    Please enter an integer: 42
                    >>> if x < 0: ... x=0 ... print('Negative changed to zero') ... elif x==0: ... print('Zero') ... elif x==1: ...
                        print('Single') ... else: ... print('More') ... More
                </code>
                <p>
                    There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is
                    useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements
                    found in other languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over
                    an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step
                    and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in
                    the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
                </p>
                <code>>>> # Measure some strings:
                    ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
                    >>> for w in words:
                    ... print(w, len(w))
                    ...
                    cat 3
                    window 6
                    defenestrate 12
                </code>
                <p>Control Flow is used for ordering:</p>

                <ul class="first-list">Structures discussed in this chapter will be:
                    <li>Stacks</li>
                    <li>Queues</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Both will be represented using lists.</p>
                <p>The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved
                (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use append(). To retrieve an item from the top of the
                stack, use pop() without an explicit index. For example</p>
                <code>>>> stack = [3, 4, 5]
                    >>> stack.append(6)
                    >>> stack.append(7)
                    >>> stack
                    [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
                    >>> stack.pop()
                    7
                    >>> stack
                    [3, 4, 5, 6]
                    >>> stack.pop()
                    6
                    >>> stack.pop()
                    5
                    >>> stack
                    [3, 4]
                </code>
                <p>
                    It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is the first element retrieved (“first-in,
                    first-out”); however, lists are not efficient for this purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list are fast,
                    doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by
                    one).
                    
                    To implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <code>>>> from collections import deque
                    >>> queue = deque(["Eric", "John", "Michael"])
                    >>> queue.append("Terry") # Terry arrives
                    >>> queue.append("Graham") # Graham arrives
                    >>> queue.popleft() # The first to arrive now leaves
                    'Eric'
                    >>> queue.popleft() # The second to arrive now leaves
                    'John'
                    >>> queue # Remaining queue in order of arrival
                    deque(['Michael', 'Terry', 'Graham'])

                If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are
                lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the
                input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your
                program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a
                handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.
                <br><br>
                To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of
                the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into
                the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in
                calculator mode).
                <br><br>
                A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py
                appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.
                For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a file called fibo.py in the current directory with the following
                contents:
            </p>
            <code># Fibonacci numbers module
                
                def fib(n): # write Fibonacci series up to n
                a, b = 0, 1
                while a < n: print(a, end=' ' ) a, b=b, a+b print() def fib2(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n result=[] a, b=0, 1
                    while a < n: result.append(a) a, b=b, a+b return result
